"""
Build romfs/pinyin_dict.bin from rime-ice YAML dict files.

Reads data/pinyin_dict_src/*.yaml (downloaded by fetch_pinyin_dict.sh),
deduplicates by (word, joined-pinyin), serializes to a binary that the
on-device IME engine can mmap-style load and binary-search.

Binary format (little-endian, 28-byte header):

    char     magic[4] = "PYIN"
    uint32_t version = 1
    uint32_t n_entries
    uint32_t pinyin_pool_off  (absolute file offset)
    uint32_t pinyin_pool_len
    uint32_t word_pool_off    (absolute file offset)
    uint32_t word_pool_len

    Entry[n_entries] {
        uint32_t pinyin_off  // offset within pinyin_pool, NUL-term ASCII
        uint32_t word_off    // offset within word_pool, NUL-term UTF-8
        uint32_t freq        // higher = more common
    }
    pinyin_pool[pinyin_pool_len]   // packed null-terminated lowercase ASCII
    word_pool[word_pool_len]       // packed null-terminated UTF-8

Entries are sorted by pinyin string lexicographically, with ties broken
by descending freq (so the most-common entry for a given pinyin shows
up first in linear scans).
